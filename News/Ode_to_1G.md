# ODE to TEC-1G
by John Melville
<br><br>
Beneath the glow of L.E.D's dance,<br>
A silicon heart is spun—<br>
A symphony of solder trails,<br>
Where old and new are one.<br>
<br>
From TEC-1’s primordial spark,<br>
This circuitscape arose:<br>
32K of RAM’s embrace,<br>
A ROM where knowledge flows.<br>
<br>
Your keys, like runes, press secrets deep,<br>
Hex codes in twilight born,<br>
While LCDs sketch ghostly lines<br>
Of futures yet unworn.<br>

A Z80’s pulse, relentless beat,<br>
Through breadboard veins it streams—<br>
A poet’s chip, unyielding, fierce,<br>
Fueling CP/M dreams.<br>

Oh, artifact of midnight toil,<br>
Of flux and solder fumes—<br>
You bridge the chasm, decade-spanned,<br>
Where retro passion blooms.<br>
<br>
For builders’ hands, your PCB gleams,<br>
A canvas vast and wild—<br>
Where 74-logic gates still sing<br>
To hackers, once a child.<br>
<br>
So here’s to chips that defy the clock,<br>
To code etched line by line—<br>
The TEC-1G, in glory spun:<br>
Our 8-bit shrine.<br>

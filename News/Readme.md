## TEC-1G RGB 8x8 Display (10/Mar/2025)
The first add-on ever developed for the original TEC-1 was an LED 8x8 Matrix Display. 40 years later and the same idea has had new life breathed into it with a full colour RGB module in the tidiest PCB yet design for the 1G, that allows for up to 3 modules chained together. Check the details at<br>

## TEC-1G Font Identified! (24/Jun/2024)
The mystery of which font goes into making the iconic TEC-1G logo has been solved by James Elphick.  At first we thought it might have been Posterama 1984 but that is owned by one of the oldest font foundry, Monotype.  James soon found a very close competitor in Montserrat-Alt1 and it is an Open Font typeface.  So in aligning with our ethos, we must have used the Open Source version and we have copied it to this GitHub, in the \Assets folder off the root:<br>

## 7 Segment Bezel by "Fred Nichols" (3/May/2024)

Now this is really cool! Fred Nichols has created a 3D printable Bezel that sits over the 7 segment displays. He has kindly released the STL files so you can download it and print it yourself or get a shop to do that for you. Either way, it makes the TEC-1G look really fancy! [Click on this link](https://github.com/turbo-gecko/TEC/tree/main/3D%20Printing/7%20Seg%20Bezel) to take you to his GitHub!

## Dedicated TEC-1G Video Channel Launched (27/Apr/2024)
Yes, we know the documentation isn't complete, and even if it were, there are many amongst us that don't do well learning anything by reading text on a screen. Some of us (raises hand) are visual learners and so videos work well for seeing how things are put together.

And that is exactly what the channel will be about. We will announce new upcoming products, have demos of peripherals available for the TEC-1G, highlight any really cool code released by you, the users, and have documentary type videos showing exactly how any board is put together.

We look forward to your feedback and let us know what you would like to see.

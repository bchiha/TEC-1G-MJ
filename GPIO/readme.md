Version 1.3 of the GPIO connector adds 4 pins to the original 16!

2 pins are spare and can be used by the user for anything they want to propagate up the GPIO stack.

We have also added the Transmit and Receive lines as used by the FTDI module.

These have been added for a NEW board, Coming Soon (tm)!

# Software Title
A screenshot or picture of the game/application in action would be nice, but not necessary.

## Description
Give us a story! The graphics on the TEC-1 are pretty rudimentary, so there is a lot of *imagination* required.
What is the object of the game? What is the point of the software?

## Requirements
What peripherals are required, if any?

## How to Play/Use
Describe the keys or interface required to interact with the game or software.

## Objectives
How do you win the game? What can you create with the software?

## Loading Instructions
Use the INTEL Hex Load to load the game. After loading, ESCape the menu, then hit Go.
(Some games, especially large ones, may need to be loaded in parts. Or they need to start running from a different
location than the usual $4000. Include all instruction to get it going.)

## Code
If the code is short, include it here in Assember listing format. If more than a page long, then include a link to a file.
